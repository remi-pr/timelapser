# Timelapser

This little Python script assembles a collection of pictures into a timelapse 
movie. It takes care of some preprocessing (resizing, rotation, adding black 
borders to vertical pictures...) and then produces a video.

## Requirements

**Timelapser** depends on :
+ **Imagemagick** and its Python bindings 
[**Wand**](http://docs.wand-py.org/en/0.4.4/).
+ [**clint**](https://github.com/kennethreitz/clint) for an awesome 
commandline interface
+ **mencoder** for the video creation

## Documentation
**timelapser** is to be used at the command line by running:
```
python timelapser.py path/to/pictures
```
Different flags can be used to set some options:
```
-r --rotation=ALPHA
    Set a rotation angle applied to all pictures before assembling 
    
-w --width=WIDTH
    Set a new width. If height is not specified, then the original aspect 
    ratio is conserved. By default: 1080

-t --height=HEIGHT
    Set a new height. If width is not specified, preserve the original aspect 
    ratio. Is ignored if width and height are specified and violate the 
    aspect ratio too much. By default: 720

-f --framerate=FRAMERATE
    Set the video framerate

-h 
    Output help and exit

```
The code is extensively commented and documented but not tested (yet?).
